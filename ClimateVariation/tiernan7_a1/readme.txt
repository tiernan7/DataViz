Any Seattle resident knows that sunny days are often plentiful in the summer, but non-existent in the winter. As a result, many us find ourselves planning sun-seeking vacations. As a grad student in Seattle, I know that I'm sun-starved, but that I rarely have the money to travel to a sunny place. When I am able to travel, its hard to know off-hand where you're likely to find sun.  Inspired by this, I wanted to create a tool to guide a Seattleite in choosing a destination and/or time for a sun-seeking vacation.  Specifically, I wanted to design a tool to help a vacationer (maybe a grad student in this department) find a month and destination to maximize their chances of experiencing sun in their destination city, when it is not sunny in Seattle (because no one wants to miss out on the beauty of the Pacific Northwest). Because everyone has different types constraints that influence when they are able to vacation, I wanted to provide a graphic that facilitates applying common constraints. These include vacationing in a certain month of the year, or choosing a set geographic region as a destination.

Because the vacation month and/or location can be variable when planning a trip, both serve as independent variables in the analysis and my aim was for users to chose an optimal time and destination, given some constraints on the time of year and/or city. Although both the city and month data are discrete quantities, I chose to use the month as an axis encoding because it is temporal in nature and has a notion of direction in its ordering, whereas a cities do not have a natural ordering. I used the x-axis for this encoding because this is generally a user's expectation of axis choice for a dependent variable. The second dependent variable, city ,was encoded as the color of the mark, which I found to give a clearer distinction between variables than varying the type of mark. Because city is a nominal quantity, I avoided changing continuous properties of the mark, like radius or area.

While the lattitude and longitude of a city are important properties of city that may correlate to the amount of sunlight and could be encoded into a property of the marking, for this graphic I chose to leave out this data under the assumption that the end user cares simply about the presence of sun and not its intensity. If the geographic dependence was also required, thus graph could be modified to include this data as a consideration (for example by varying the size of the mark). 

Initially, I knew that I wanted the y-axis encoding to give information about the amount of sunlight for each city and month pairing, but this left much of the computation about how to plan their vacation up to the user and their short-term memory, rather than encoding it into the graph. To improve upon this, I first converted each monthly sunlight hour measurement to a probability by dividing by the number of hours in the given month. As I'll discuss later, this maybe misleading as a predictive value, but preserves the important trends, and presents a value is more useful to the user without any additional computation. Lastly because my audience is a seattle resident, I encoded the considering the probability of sunny weather by removing the Seattle data series from the plot and multiplying the sunshine probability for each city by the probability that it is not sunny in seattle during a point in that given month, giving the joint probability that it is sunny in the destination city, but not in Seattle. This way if there is a high probability beautiful weather in Seattle, that a vacationer won't, the plotted values will be lower destinations in those months than months when. This can be seen in the plot during the summer months, when Seattle experiences its must sun, suggesting that overall the winter may be the best time to plan a vacation barring any other decisions, Essentially the user can visually compute the relative likelihood between choices of city and month that their trip will lead to them gaining sunlight they would not have experienced in seattle.

For the choice of marking shape, I started making a scatter plot, but I found this made it more difficult to follow data attributed to the same city across different months. For example, if I was a vacationer  To make it easier to chose a city and find a time that maximizes the probability of sun I converted the mark to a line plot. I chose not to interpolate the line to make it clear, by the jagged appearance of the trend, that the data was binned 

The fact that the original hourly sunlight data has been binned monthly bounds the usefulness in cases where there may be large variations in sunlight hours across a month. The result of the monthly binning of sunlight data is that sunlight probabilities are averaged across all hours in a month. Thus, if a city is usually much sunnier than Seattle at the start of a month, but much darker at the end, after taking averaging monthly, both sunlight values would be similar, so this trend would not be apparent in the visualization. However, I do not intend for this chart to be a quantitative tool in terms of probabilities, and instead a general guide for choosing a destination city/region and time of year. On the whole, I expect someone using their chart to aid in their vacation planning, but it is likely that other factors will take priority on choosing exact dates, so this monthly binning does not completely eliminate the usefulness of the tool.The fact that the original hourly sunlight data has been binned monthly bounds the usefulness in cases where there may be large variations in sunlight hours across a month.

Lastly, for those who know what month they want to travel and simply want to find the sunniest destination during that month, I have added a colored bar to the x-axis representing the city with the highest probability of gaining sunlight while visiting during that month. From this data one would expect that they should travel to Miami in the winter, Chicago in the dead of summer, and San Francisco during. This agrees with my personal experience.

A last quick note, that because the climate is becoming increasingly unstable, the conclusions derived from this analysis may not persist as sunlight patterns change relative to the patterns at the time this data was collected.

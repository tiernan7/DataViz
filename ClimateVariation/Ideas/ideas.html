            <h2>Visualization ideas</h2>
                <p> Here is list of ideas that I've thought up for visualizing the climate data. My main goal is to create a graphic for the general public, that I will distruvte on social media, that will convince the public that human impacrt on the climate is/will having/have an impact on their quality of life. Some of these ideas include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Viualize american days with more clody cities than seattle </li>
                    <li> Augement sunlight data with seasonable depression related info </li>
                    <li> Link climate change to politcal/economic process - Show people that </li>
                    <li> Show correlations between perceived adverse changeds in climate with multiple factors such as recycling/coorporate tax breaks</li>
                </ul>

                <p> In exploring the data in python with various matplotlib visualization methods, I observed the following from the data: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> There is no way to track human impact, becuase the time dependece of the data has been obscured by averaging </li>
                    <li> Cities like miami known for sunny days dont necessarily have the sunniest summers</li>
                    <li> Could potentially focus on a guide for travellers, focus on summer </li>
                    <li> Plot a scatter accross the summer months (maybe may - september) indicating which cities have their sunniest summer months<li>
                </ul>

                <p>After working through the data, I think I would like to make a tool for summer vacationers. This tool will have the summer months on the x-axis. There will be a point at an x-axis position for every city that has its sunniest summer month in that month. The associated y-value will be the chance of visiting on a sunny day. This type of chart would let travelelrs narrow down their summer planning by giving an indication of when american cities are most likely to be sunny during the window in which people are likely to vacation in the northern hemisphere </p>



                <p> Following along this same line of developing a visual aid for vacationers making travel plans, I could also restrict it to travelers ~from~ a specific city. For example, I know many grad students who are looking to travel when seattle is in its cloudy season. A useful tool could plot the cities each moneth that are more likely to be sunny than seattle, with y values based on how much more sunny</p>

                <h2>Concise goal</h2>
                <p>Where should I vacation to escape the Seattle weather?</p>
                <h2>Plot elements</h2>
                    <li>Month&rarr;X</li>
                    <li>City, not including Seattle&rarr;Y</li>
                    <li>Average P(Sunny in city Y during onth X, Not Sunny in Seattle on a day in month ) accross month. &rarr;Circle Position</li>
                    <li>Thermal intensity relative to Seattle&rarr;Circle Area<\li>
                <h2>Justification</h2>
                    <li> I considered using a different metric for the Y-axis such as the the number of sunny days in city X minus the number of sunny days in seattle per month. I also considred plotting, for month in the year<\li>
                    
                    <li>Because the hours of sunlight havr been binned monthly, the probabilities of a sunny day are really average probabilities across the month and might lose any predictive power there are sharp variations in sunlight distrobution across a particular month. However this is not possible with data averaged over a small period, and as such this graphic should work as only a starting point for chosing a city to visit in a given time, or finding a time to go to a particular city.</li>
                    <li>The solar radiation data is based on a typical meteorological year, and reported in half hour intervals.</li>

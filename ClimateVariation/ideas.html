                    <li> Augement sunlight data with seasonable depression related info </li>
                    <li> Link climate change to politcal/economic process - Show people that </li>
                    <li> Show correlations between perceived adverse changeds in climate with multiple factors such as recycling/coorporate tax breaks</li>
